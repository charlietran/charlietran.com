### oh hello again

It has been a few years since I've regularly written anything in a public way.
More than a dozen in fact -- the last time I can recall doing so was just after
high school, and I am now 34 years and 3 months old. 

My first instinct was to kick this off with a technical post, since my capital-B
Brand purports to be: funny, handsome, knowledgable programmer. But [this
post][1] by Julia Evans has made me reconsider what goals I have for writing
blog posts, and the chief reason would be to kick off interesting conversations.
And to start off, let's do a conversation I often have with myself!

### how did you get here? 

And to be more specific about "here", how do I find myself writing my first blog
post in 12 years, late on a Sunday night at my kitchen table, in my Brooklyn
apartment? Well, for the writing bit, it's because I'm currently at the [Recurse
Center][2], and fellow Recurser [Katie][3] has kicked off an [Iron Blogger][4]
challenge, the gist of which is that I've committed to writing a blog post a
week.

### how and why did you end up at the recurse center?

In June 2018, [I applied][4] and had two friendly interviews with former Recursers,
and then they accepted me for a 3 month batch. I would summarize RC as something
like "art school for programmers", which is to say: a dedicated time and space
for self-directed programming education, with a strong emphasis on sharing your
work, and a strong disposition against established habits and pretension.

And like art school (so I hear), they heavily expect and encourage some amount
of "floundering", i.e. struggling to figure out what to do next, as that's a
sign that you're getting better at self-directing. Which I think is fantastic,
since I'd much rather be floundering in a group than floundering independently,
which is what I'd been doing from October 2017 til June 2018.

### and why had you been floundering alone those 9 months?

In October 2017, I quit my job at VHX after 4.5 years, which was one of the
hardest decisions I've ever made and still affects me to this day. Well
technically, the company I quit was Vimeo, after [Vimeo acquired VHX][5] in
mid-2016, and then renamed the division to [Vimeo OTT][6]. I was Director of
Engineering (second in command) for most of my time at VHX, and became the de
facto head of engineering after the original CTO left.

It was the best job I've ever had. And the people I met there are still some of
my closest friends to this day. But going through most of a full startup life
cycle, including the intense pre and post-acquisition adjustments, really
drained me of my mental energy and my commitment to the job. I knew I had to
leave while I could still have those valued friendships, and before I was fully
engulfed by the bitter cynicism that is endemic to tech nowadays.

And after I quit, I thought: *Great, I finally can do my own startup, or make
videogames on my own, like I've always wanted!* But, it turns out that's really
quite hard to do on your own. Thus, the floundering.

It also didn't help that I disconnected from one of my main social circles just
as 3 months of dark, brutal New York winter was starting up. Definitely going to
time that better next time!

### okay, and before that?

That's enough for this starter post ;) How I ended up at VHX, in tech, and in
Brooklyn is probably best saved for another time! Till then, thanks for reading.
