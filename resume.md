*I'm currently studying graphics programming and game design at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com). Open to new opportunities that can leverage
my web engineering and leadership experience towards new forms of media and 
user interaction.*

**Vimeo ([https://ott.vimeo.com](https://ott.vimeo.com))**  
*Senior Director of Engineering &bull; June 2016 - Oct 2017 &bull; New York, NY*  


* Joined Vimeo via its [acquisition of VHX](https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11554434/vimeo-acquires-vhx)
* Some things I shipped at Vimeo:
  * API-based integrations of the VHX Ruby on Rails app into the Vimeo PHP stack
    to begin combining our media assets and customer databases
  * Growing both backend &amp; frontend teams by 50% and organizing them into
    cross-functional teams focused on product objectives instead of tech stacks
  * A scaling & performance initiative for the Rails app stack to handle the
    post-acquisition 10x traffic increase
  * A custom video transcoding pipeline running on AWS to add support for 4K/HDR
    video, decreasing our transcoding costs by 50% and improving playback quality
  * Reworking our Java-based video streaming servers to allow for live-encoded
    DRM and adaptive streaming
  * Migration of the Rails app and microservices to Docker along so they could
    be cloud platform-agnostic

**VHX ([https://www.vhx.tv](https://www.vhx.tv))**  
*Director of Engineering &bull; Aug 2013 - June 2016 &bull; Brooklyn, NY*  

* Lead a team of 8 engineers that took a streaming video product from MVP to
  acquisition
* Some things I shipped at VHX:
  * A payments infrastructure for our online video marketplace with thousands
    of sellers and millions of customers, compliant with federal and
    international law
  * In-app purchasing for all our sellers' apps on iOS, Android, and Roku,
    which boosted seller revenue by 200%
  * An upgrade for our streaming video infrastructure from progressive H264 to
    encrypted Apple HLS
  * Automation of our Continuous Integration setup, allowing engineers to 
    deploy to production dozens of times a day and provision test servers via 
    a custom chat bot
  * A zero-downtime credit card migration of 1 million+ paying customers
    between providers (Balanced to Stripe)
