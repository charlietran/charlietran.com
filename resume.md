*I'm currently studying graphics programming and game design at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com). Open to new opportunities that can leverage
my web engineering and leadership experience towards new forms of media and 
user interaction.*

<h2 class="section_heading">Experience</h2>
**Vimeo ([https://ott.vimeo.com](https://ott.vimeo.com))**  
*Senior Director of Engineering / June 2016 - Oct 2017 / New York, NY*  


* Joined Vimeo via its [acquisition of VHX](https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11554434/vimeo-acquires-vhx).
* Some projects I shipped while at Vimeo:
  * Integrating the VHX Rails app into the Vimeo PHP stack where possible.
  * Scaling the engineering team and Rails application stack to handle the
    demands of a product pivot towards enterprise.
  * A custom video transcoding pipeline running on AWS, based on Vimeo's
    existing technology, to migrate from the pre-acquisition transcoding
    provider and also add support for 4K/HDR video via HEVC.
  * Migration of the Rails app and microservices to Docker along so they could
    be cloud platform-agnostic.

**VHX ([https://www.vhx.tv](https://www.vhx.tv))**  
*Director of Engineering / Aug 2013 - June 2016 / Brooklyn, NY*  


* Lead a team of Ruby on Rails engineers that took a streaming video product
  from MVP to acquisition. The product enabled any size media business to launch
  an OTT streaming video network, similar to Netflix or HBO.
* Some of the things I built while at VHX:
    * A payments infrastructure for our online video marketplace with thousands
      of sellers and millions of customers, compliant with federal and
      international law.
    * In-app purchasing for all our sellers' apps on iOS, Android, and Roku.
    * An upgrade for our streaming video infrastructure from progressive H264 to
      encrypted Apple HLS.
    * Automation of our Continuous Integration setup, allowing engineers to 
      deploy to production dozens of times a day and provision test servers via 
      a custom chat bot.
    * A zero-downtime migration of millions of paying credit card customers
      between providers (Balanced to Stripe)

**Consulting**  
*March 2011 - July 2013 / New York, NY*  

* Worked as a developer consultant for several NYC agencies. Projects included:
