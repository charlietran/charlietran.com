*I'm currently studying graphics programming and game design at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com). Open to new opportunities that can leverage
my web engineering and leadership experience towards new forms of media and 
user interaction.*

<h2 class="section_heading">Experience</h2>
**Vimeo ([https://ott.vimeo.com](https://ott.vimeo.com))**  
*Senior Director of Engineering / June 2016 - Oct 2017*  
*New York, NY*  


* Joined Vimeo via its [acquisition of VHX](https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11554434/vimeo-acquires-vhx).
* Grew the engineering team and led the integration of our product into the Vimeo stack.
* Scaled the engineering team and Rails application stack to handle the
  increased demands of a product pivot towards enterprise.
* Built a custom video transcoding pipeline running on AWS based on Vimeo's
  existing technology, to migrate from our pre-acquisition transcoding
  provider and also add support for 4K/HDR video via HEVC.
* Migrated the Rails monolith to Docker along with its satellite microservices
  so they could be cloud platform-agnostic.

**VHX ([https://www.vhx.tv](https://www.vhx.tv))**  
*Director of Engineering / Aug 2013 - June 2016*  
*Brooklyn, NY*  


* Lead a team of Ruby on Rails engineers that took a streaming video product
  from MVP to acquisition. The product enabled any size media business to launch
  an OTT streaming video network, similar to Netflix or HBO.
* A few things I shipped at VHX:
    * A payments infrastructure for our online video marketplace with thousands
      of sellers and millions of customers, compliant with federal and
      international laws.
    * An upgrade for our streaming video infrastructure from progressive H264 to
      encrypted Apple HLS.
    * Automation of the testing and Continuous Integration setup, allowing
      engineers to reliably deploy to production dozens of times a day.
    * A custom chat bot for DevOps that allows engineers to reserve and deploy
      to our internal servers.
    * A zero-downtime migration of millions of paying credit card customers
      between providers (Balanced to Stripe)

**Consulting**  
*March 2011 - July 2013*
